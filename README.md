<sup>
<b>MovieSpectrum is a (very) simple program that you can use to extract the color spectrum of a film or a video.</b>
</sup>
</p>

# How to use it?
Define the script parameters in params.py.
You will have to adjust IMAGE_WIDTH, IMAGE_HEIGHT for the output picture, and SAMPLE_NUMBER to define the number of frames to be used to build the spectrum.

Then, from a terminal supply a video path :

    spectrum.py Porco\ Rosso.avi

# Averaging methods
You can also play with average methods, square average seems to give the best results.
K-Mean seems unless you are working with a very small SAMPLE_NUMBER, as it will take way too much time for not that good of a result.

A window will popup and the spectrum will start building. When you are finished, press Q to exit.
